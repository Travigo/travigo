# Common Transport Data Format

The Common Transport Data Format (CTDF) is a standardised transport data format that is used in BritBus and is used to model everything related to public transport.

The BritBus data-importer is used to convert other formats into CTDF, which the main BritBus application & API then uses - this simplifies the application as all servcies only need to know how to parse CTDF and not the many other formats that transport data comes in
